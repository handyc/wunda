# wunda
1D paintlike annotation program for text

# sources
texts are unicode strings of arbitrary, unlimited length

# annotations
annotations are additional information related to specific
position sets (begin, end) of highlighted text from a source text

# timestamps
every annotation is recorded in absolute time

# undo / redo stack
annotations made on texts can be undone and repeated,
just like a 2D paint program

# layers
annotation layers allow different kinds of annotations
to be revealed and concealed

# names
annotations can be given unique string identifiers
(e.g. "X34", "Blueberry", "Notes from the field")

# color
color highlighting of texts to provide visual cues for
related items
